# OpenClaw Config Repository

Complete inventory of what this repository (`openclaw-config`) provides — the shareable
configuration layer for OpenClaw instances.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-09

---

## What This Repo Is

This is the **upstream source** for all OpenClaw instances. It contains the templates,
skills, workflows, devops specs, and knowledge that get deployed to live instances. It
is NOT the OpenClaw gateway code itself — it's the configuration and tooling layer.

**Deployment model:** The `openclaw` skill copies files from this repo to a live
instance's workspace (`~/.openclaw/workspace/`). Upstream-owned files (algorithms,
templates, skills) are overwritten on update. User-owned files (rules, notes, logs) are
never touched.

**Public repo:** This is open-source and intended to be shareable. Zero PII, zero fleet
specifics. Generic placeholders in all examples.

## Skills (17)

Each skill is self-contained: `SKILL.md` (metadata) + executable script (same name as
directory). No shared code, no project-level dependencies.

### Skill Architecture

- **Python skills:** Use `uv run` with inline `# /// script` dependencies — no
  pyproject.toml, no virtualenv setup needed
- **Bash skills:** Thin wrappers around external CLIs
- **Meta skills:** SKILL.md only (instructions/methodology, no executable)
- **Testing:** Integration tests in `tests/` auto-skip without API keys

## Workflows (9)

Autonomous agents that run on schedules, maintain state, and learn from corrections.

### Active Workflows

| Workflow          | What It Does                                                                                | Key Files                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| email-steward     | Inbox triage — archive noise, surface important mail. Prompt injection defenses.            | AGENT.md                                 |
| task-steward      | Classify work, create tasks, execute via sub-agents, QA verification.                       | AGENT.md                                 |
| calendar-steward  | Daily briefing with travel logistics, meeting prep, conflict detection.                     | AGENT.md                                 |
| contact-steward   | Detect unknown contacts across WhatsApp/iMessage/Quo, classify, organize.                   | AGENT.md, classifier.md, platforms/\*.md |
| cron-healthcheck  | Detect broken cron jobs, auto-remediate common issues. Two-tier model (triage + diagnosis). | AGENT.md, agent_notes.md                 |
| learning-loop     | Capture corrections → detect patterns → validate → promote to memory.                       | AGENT.md, agent_notes.md, rules.md       |
| llm-usage-report  | Daily LLM spend breakdown by session and model. Empathy pass for tone.                      | AGENT.md, agent_notes.md, logs/          |
| security-sentinel | Research AI security threats, map to OpenClaw architecture, verify fleet exposure via SSH.  | AGENT.md, agent_notes.md                 |
| mailroom-steward  | Advanced email routing (not yet implemented — directory exists with logs/ only).            | —                                        |

### Workflow File Ownership

**Upstream-owned** (updated by this repo):

- `AGENT.md` — the algorithm definition
- `classifier.md` — classification logic (where applicable)
- `platforms/*.md` — platform-specific guides

**User-owned** (never overwritten):

- `rules.md` — user preferences and thresholds
- `agent_notes.md` — learned patterns (accumulated over time)
- `preferences.md` — user-specific settings
- `processed.md` — tracking what's been handled
- `logs/` — execution history

### Workflow Architecture

- Each workflow is a prompt + context that runs via the cron runner
- State persists in markdown files between runs
- `agent_notes.md` accumulates over time — workflows get smarter
- Corrections feed into `learning-loop`, which promotes patterns back to workflows
- Workflows can invoke skills (e.g., email-steward uses agentmail)

- Escalates: failures to admin via Telegram
- Silent success model — only notifies on problems

### machine-setup.md (macOS)

Desired-state specification covering:

- Power management (prevent sleep)
- Permissions, Brewfile, Node.js setup
- Gateway config and service installation
- Automated backup with retention
- Workspace structure and agent defaults
- Health check admin notification setup

### machine-setup-linux.md

Linux-specific setup:

- Tailscale, SSH hardening
- System packages, Node.js, pnpm
- Gateway config with systemd
- Backup with systemd timers

### machine-security-review.md

Two-mode security agent:

- **Drift detection** (daily) — fast check for changes since baseline
- **Full audit + red team** (weekly) — comprehensive review including adversarial
  testing
- Checks: firewall, open ports, file permissions, SSH config, API key exposure, cron
  integrity, prompt injection, skill script integrity
- Auto-fixes safe issues, escalates everything else

### notification-routing.md

Two-lane notification model:

- **Lane 1 (Admin):** System health alerts to fleet admin via Telegram
- **Lane 2 (User):** Cron outputs to the instance's host person
- Per-machine configuration in `~/.openclaw/health-check-admin`

These commands run from the fleet master machine (this repo) and operate on remote
machines via SSH.
