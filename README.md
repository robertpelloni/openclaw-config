# OpenClaw Config

Most AI assistants forget you the moment the conversation ends. OpenClaw doesn't.

This repo is the shared configuration layer for OpenClaw — a personal AI built on
[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that maintains persistent
memory, integrates with real-world tools, and runs autonomous workflows on a schedule.
Everything is markdown and Python scripts. No frameworks, no databases, no lock-in.

## What You Get

- **Memory that persists** — Three-tier architecture: always-loaded essentials, daily
  context files, and deep knowledge with semantic search
- **14 skills** — Web research, meeting transcripts, CRM, phone system, voice calling,
  task management, and more — each a standalone Python script with zero setup
- **6 autonomous workflows** — Agents that triage your inbox, manage tasks, prep your
  calendar, organize contacts, monitor security threats, and keep cron jobs healthy —
  learning your preferences over time
- **Templates for identity** — Define your AI's personality, your profile, and how it
  should operate
- **DevOps included** — Hourly health checks, fleet management across machines,
  automated backups

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) running
on your machine. That's it — no other dependencies.

**Install:** Open Claude Code and tell it:

```
Set up openclaw-config from https://github.com/TechNickAI/openclaw-config
```

The `openclaw` skill walks you through setup — cloning the repo, copying templates,
creating memory folders, and configuring optional features like semantic search.

**Update later:**

```
Update my openclaw config
```

## Workflows

Workflows are autonomous agents that run on a schedule. Unlike skills (tools you
invoke), workflows maintain state, learn your preferences, and manage themselves.

| Workflow              | What it does                                                   | Version |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **email-steward**     | Triage inbox — archive noise, label, alert on important        | 0.3.0   |
| **task-steward**      | Classify work, create tasks, spawn sub-agents, QA results      | 0.1.0   |
| **calendar-steward**  | Daily briefing — travel time, meeting prep, conflict detection | 0.1.0   |
| **contact-steward**   | Detect unknown contacts across platforms, classify & organize  | 0.2.0   |
| **security-sentinel** | Threat intelligence research & fleet exposure mapping          | 0.1.0   |
| **cron-healthcheck**  | Detect broken cron jobs, auto-remediate, escalate failures     | 0.1.0   |

Each workflow maintains its own state:

- `AGENT.md` — The algorithm (updates when you update openclaw-config)
- `rules.md` — Your preferences (never overwritten)
- `agent_notes.md` — Patterns it learns over time
- `logs/` — Execution history

## Memory Architecture

Most AI memory is "dump everything into a vector database." OpenClaw uses deliberate,
structured memory with clear tiers:

**Tier 1 — Always loaded.** `MEMORY.md` stays in context every conversation. Curated to
~100 lines of what matters most.

**Tier 2 — Daily context.** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files. Today and yesterday load
automatically. Raw observations, not curated.

**Tier 3 — Deep knowledge.** `memory/people/`, `projects/`, `topics/`, `decisions/`.
Searched via vector embeddings (LM Studio local or OpenAI). Retrieved when relevant, not
loaded by default.

The **librarian** skill promotes durable knowledge upward — daily observations become
structured knowledge, structured knowledge gets summarized into MEMORY.md.

What gets remembered is filtered through four criteria:

| Criterion          | Question                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Durability**     | Will this matter in 30+ days?     |
| **Uniqueness**     | Is this new or already captured?  |
| **Retrievability** | Will I want to recall this later? |
| **Authority**      | Is this reliable?                 |

## Design Principles

- **Files over databases** — Markdown in git beats any proprietary store. Readable,
  diffable, portable.
- **Self-contained skills** — No shared dependencies, no coordination overhead. Each
  skill carries its own `pip install` inline.
- **Workflows that learn** — Agents should get better at their job over time, not just
  repeat the same script.
- **Two-way door decisions** — Act freely on reversible decisions. Pause and confirm on
  irreversible ones.
- **Prose over config** — Language models reason better in natural language than in JSON
  schemas.

## DevOps

Infrastructure-as-code for running OpenClaw in production. Supports macOS (launchd) and
Linux (systemd) with the same operational model.

### Health Monitoring

`devops/health-check.md` is an autonomous agent that runs every 30 minutes via cron. It
checks gateway liveness, model catalog health, cron job status, channel connectivity,
disk/memory, and log health. It can fix routine issues (restart services, kill hung
processes, clean old logs) and escalates to the fleet owner when things break that were
working.

Health checks follow a **silent success** model — the admin only gets notified when
something is wrong or was fixed, never for routine health.

### Machine Setup

Desired-state specifications that define what a healthy OpenClaw machine looks like:

| File                            | Platform | What it covers                                      |
| ------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `devops/machine-setup.md`       | macOS    | Power management, Node, launchd services, backups   |
| `devops/machine-setup-linux.md` | Linux    | EC2 setup, systemd services, SSH, package deps      |
| `devops/apt-packages.txt`       | Linux    | Required packages (jq, restic, tmux, git, bat, etc) |

Each section follows the pattern: **desired state** → **verify command** → **fix
command**. The health check agent uses these specs for drift detection.

### Security Hardening

`devops/machine-security-review.md` is a security-focused agent that runs daily (drift
detection) and weekly (full audit + red team). It checks firewall config, open ports,
file permissions, SSH hardening, credential exposure, prompt injection in memory/agent
files, skill script integrity, and MCP tool poisoning. It can auto-fix safe issues
(permission tightening) and escalates everything else to the fleet admin.

The companion `workflows/security-sentinel/` researches emerging AI security threats
weekly and maps them against the fleet's exposure.

### Notification Routing

`devops/notification-routing.md` defines a two-lane model:

- **Admin lane** — System health alerts go to the fleet owner (e.g., "gateway down on
  machine-2")
- **User lane** — Cron outputs go to the host person (e.g., EOD briefing, email alerts)

Lanes never mix. Health check agents use `delivery.mode: "none"` and self-notify the
admin directly.

### Automation Services

Three services run on every OpenClaw machine, defined as launchd plists (`devops/mac/`)
or systemd units (`devops/linux/`):

| Service              | Schedule         | Purpose                                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **health-check**     | Every 30 min     | Run health-check.md agent via Claude CLI                      |
| **workspace-backup** | Every 4 hours    | Restic backup of ~/.openclaw + workspace (7d/4w/6m retention) |
| **backup-verify**    | Weekly (Sun 4am) | Restic integrity check (10% of data)                          |

### Fleet Management

For multi-machine deployments, the `/fleet` command manages remote OpenClaw instances
from a master machine. Fleet state lives in `~/openclaw-fleet/` (one markdown file per
server). The `gateway-restart` skill ensures graceful restarts that don't interrupt
active conversations.

## Documentation

Deep-dive guides for advanced setups and multi-agent coordination:

| Document                                   | Purpose                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **knowledge/multi-agent-communication.md** | Setup multi-agent coordination across separate OpenClaw gateways via Slack @-mentions |
| **knowledge/fleet-boot-patterns.md**       | Complete runbook for booting, scaling, and managing a fleet of 3+ agents              |

### Multi-Agent Coordination

If you're running multiple OpenClaw instances that need to coordinate:

- **Single-gateway multi-agent:** Fast in-process communication via `sessions_send()`
- **Multi-gateway fleet:** Isolated agents across machines/VPS, coordinating via Slack

Both patterns are documented with working configs, troubleshooting guides, and boot
runbooks.

## Development

```bash
uv run --with pytest pytest tests/ -v
```

Integration tests auto-skip when API keys aren't set.
