# HEARTBEAT.md

## Periodic Checks (Rotate, 1-2 per heartbeat)

- [ ] Urgent emails (check if >4h since last check)
- [ ] Calendar next 24h (check if >8h since last check)

## Daily Checks

- [ ] Config updates: check if openclaw-config has updates, apply them if available
- [ ] Learning loop: if `memory/learning/patterns.md` has high- or medium-confidence
      unvalidated candidates >= the threshold in `workflows/learning-loop/rules.md`, run
      validation (see `workflows/learning-loop/AGENT.md` Phase 3)

## Rules

- Late night (23:00-08:00): skip periodic unless urgent
- If all clear: HEARTBEAT_OK
- If action needed: handle it, don't just report
