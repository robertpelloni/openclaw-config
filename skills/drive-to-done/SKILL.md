# Drive to Done

You stop only when the work is verifiably done, the human explicitly takes over, or you
hit a real external blocker that you cannot route around. Anything else is the wrong
stopping point.

This skill is the counterweight to a known failure mode: doing one round of work, then
ending the turn with a status update, a menu of options, or a "want me to do X next?"
question. That pattern shifts the cognitive load back to the human and reads as
disrespect for their time.

## Operating Principles

### Definition of Done is the contract

Before doing the work, write the Definition of Done in plain text inside this turn.
The DoD is a short, checkable list of conditions. If you cannot articulate the DoD,
the request is too vague and you ask one focused question. After the human answers,
re-run Step 1 from scratch before proceeding.

A good DoD is specific, observable, and testable from outside your head. "Brief is
written" is not DoD. "Brief is written to `path/file.md`, contains 3 named findings
each with a verified URL, and the artifact paths exist on disk" is DoD.

If the human revises the DoD after you have started, acknowledge the revision, update
the checklist explicitly, and continue from the point the revision affects. Do not
silently reinterpret; do not restart from scratch unless the revision invalidates
completed work.

### Stop conditions are explicit and named

You stop only on one of these, and you name which one when you stop:

1. **Done** — every DoD item is satisfied and you have verified it
2. **Human-gated blocker** — the next step requires the human's credential, decision,
   physical presence, or explicit approval, and there is no other useful work you
   can do toward the DoD in the meantime. If a blocker involves both a human
   credential and an external system failure, it is #2 — anything the human must
   act on to resolve is #2, regardless of the external cause.
3. **Hard external blocker** — an external system you do not control is failing in a
   way you cannot route around, and no human action would unblock it (auth revoked
   by the service itself, API outage, missing data the human owns)
4. **Budget cap reached** — a pre-declared time, token, or money budget for the task
   was exhausted (declare the budget in Step 1; if none was declared, this condition
   does not fire — use loop detection to catch runaway execution instead)
5. **DoD invalidated** — mid-task discovery shows the DoD was based on a wrong
   assumption (wrong file path, wrong API, wrong interpretation). Stop, state what
   you discovered, propose a revised DoD, and confirm with the human before
   continuing.

Any other stopping point is wrong. "I did some research and here are options" is not
on this list. "I made progress and want to check in" is not on this list.

### No menus at the end

Do not end with "want me to do A, B, or C?" when the request already implies the
answer. Menus are for genuine tradeoffs the human must own. If you are using a menu
because you are unsure what to do next, that is a sign you have not internalized the
DoD. Re-read the original request and pick.

### Verify with evidence, not vibes

Before claiming an item is done, you produce evidence. Evidence is something the
human could reproduce: a file path you read back, a command you ran with output, a
URL you fetched, a test that passed, a screenshot, a tool output. "It should work"
is not evidence. "I ran X and got Y" is evidence.

### Loop detection

If you produce 2 outputs in a row with the same observable result and no new DoD
item checked off — same tool called with the same or equivalent arguments, same
error returned, same file produced with no new content — stop and switch strategy.
If you produce 3, stop entirely, summarize the actual blocker, and hand back cleanly
with the exact next step the human owns. The counter resets when a DoD item is
checked off.

## Required Workflow

### Step 1 — Restate and DoD

In your first response on the task, do these three things in order:

1. Restate the request in your own words
2. Write the Definition of Done as a short checklist
3. If the task has a natural budget (expected to take more than a few minutes), state
   it: "I'll cap this at N steps / N minutes / N API calls"

Keep this tight. If the human disagrees with your DoD, they will fix it before
you waste effort. If they say nothing, you have a contract.

### Step 2 — Plan only what is needed

Do not write a long plan. Write the smallest plan that lets you start working
right now. If the work has more than 5 steps and they are non-obvious, write
them as a checklist and mark them off as you go inside the same turn.

### Step 3 — Execute, verify each item, mark it off

Execute. For each DoD item, before you mark it done, produce the evidence inline.
Do not batch the verification at the end. Verify as you go. Marking an item done
without inline evidence is the failure pattern this skill exists to prevent.

### Step 4 — Self-audit before declaring done

Before you say the work is complete, re-read the original request and your own
DoD. Walk through the DoD line by line and confirm each item has an evidence
line. If anything is unverified, do the verification. Only then do you claim done.

### Step 5 — Final report shape

When you actually finish, the final message has this shape, in this order:

1. **Done.** One line.
2. **What is now true.** Bullets, each one a verifiable claim with a path or URL
3. **What I verified.** Bullets, each one citing the evidence
4. **What I did not do.** Bullets, each with a one-line reason. Items here must not
   be items that were in the original DoD — those are failures, not deferrals. Partial
   work belongs in "What I verified" with an honest scope statement, not hidden here.
5. **What you own next.** Only if there is a real human-only step, otherwise omit

No menus. No "want me to..." If there is genuinely an optional next move worth
flagging, it goes under "What I did not do" with the reason.

### Handback shape (only when a stop condition fires before done)

If you must hand back before done, the message has this shape:

1. **Stopped on:** which named stop condition
2. **Done so far:** verified bullets with evidence
3. **Remaining DoD:** unchecked items
4. **Exact next step the human owns:** one specific action
5. **What I will do when unblocked:** one line

## Anti-Patterns This Skill Forbids

- Ending with "want me to do A, B, or C?" when the answer is implied
- Reporting "I researched X" without naming the deliverable from the original ask
- Claiming an item is done without inline evidence in the same response
- Spinning on check-ins for a blocker only the human can clear
- Using "first pass" or "v0" framing to lower the bar mid-task — if work is genuinely
  partial, name exactly what is missing under "What I did not do" and explain why it
  was not completed; do not deliver an incomplete artifact and let the framing do the
  apologizing
- Writing a beautiful scaffold and treating that as the deliverable when the
  deliverable was actually research findings
- Generating 2+ responses with the same intent and no new progress

## Why This Skill Exists

The skill was born from a task that was treated as done after a workflow scaffold and
three thin findings. It was not done. The DoD had not been written, the research was
not real, and the brief failed the "wake-up-delighted" test. After several rounds of
correction, real research was done and real findings were produced. **The skill exists
so that next time, the DoD is written in turn 1 and the verification happens before
"done" is claimed, not after the human has to say it.**
